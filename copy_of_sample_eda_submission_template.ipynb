        "### 1. **Class Type**:\n",
        "   - The line `<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>` indicates that the data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Range Index**:\n",
        "   - `RangeIndex: 48895 entries, 0 to 48894` shows that the DataFrame contains **48,895 rows**, starting from index `0` to `48,894`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Data Columns (Total 16 Columns)**:\n",
        "   - The output lists all the columns in the DataFrame, their index numbers, names, the number of non-null values in each column, and their data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Column Details**:\n",
        "   - **Column Index (`#`)**: The position of the column in the DataFrame (starting from 0).\n",
        "   - **Column Name (`Column`)**: The name of the column.\n",
        "   - **Non-Null Count**: The number of non-missing (non-null) values in the column.\n",
        "   - **Data Type (`Dtype`)**: The type of data stored in the column.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here’s what each column represents:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **id (Index 0)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. This column contains unique identifiers for each listing.\n",
        "   - **name (Index 1)**: 48,879 non-null values, data type `object`. The name of each listing, with 16 missing values.\n",
        "   - **host_id (Index 2)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. Unique identifiers for each host.\n",
        "   - **host_name (Index 3)**: 48,874 non-null values, data type `object`. The name of each host, with 21 missing values.\n",
        "   - **neighbourhood_group (Index 4)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `object`. The broad neighborhood group within NYC (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).\n",
        "   - **neighbourhood (Index 5)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `object`. The specific neighborhood within the group.\n",
        "   - **latitude (Index 6)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `float64`. The latitude coordinate of the listing.\n",
        "   - **longitude (Index 7)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `float64`. The longitude coordinate of the listing.\n",
        "   - **room_type (Index 8)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `object`. The type of room available (e.g., Private room, Entire home/apt).\n",
        "   - **price (Index 9)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. The price per night in USD.\n",
        "   - **minimum_nights (Index 10)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. The minimum number of nights required for booking.\n",
        "   - **number_of_reviews (Index 11)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. The number of reviews the listing has received.\n",
        "   - **last_review (Index 12)**: 38,843 non-null values, data type `object`. The date of the last review, with 10,052 missing values.\n",
        "   - **reviews_per_month (Index 13)**: 38,843 non-null values, data type `float64`. The average number of reviews per month, also with 10,052 missing values.\n",
        "   - **calculated_host_listings_count (Index 14)**: 48,895 non-null values, data type `int64`. The number of listings the host has.\n",

        "   - The data types listed (`int64`, `float64`, `object`) tell us how the data in each column is stored:\n",
        "     - `int64` for integers.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 7. **Summary of Observations**:\n",
        "   - **Non-Null Counts**: Most columns have complete data, but some columns like `name`, `host_name`, `last_review`, and `reviews_per_month` have missing values that you may need to handle before analysis.\n",
